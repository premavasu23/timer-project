# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements

Please construct a countdown timer that is rendered in the browser. A user should be able to use this as a simple timer by adding time and starting and stopping it. Here is a full list of requirements:
- The clock should display four digits for minutes and seconds with a colon between, eg 00:00
- Controls should allow users to:
    - Add one minute to the timer
    - Add 10 seconds to the timer
    - Add one second to the timer
    - Start / Stop the timer
    - Reset the timer to zero
- Once the timer reaches zero, the timer should stop counting down and default to the reset state. Adding an effect of some sort to indicate that the timer has reached zero is encouraged but is not required.
This timer must be precise â€“ Precision should be on a 100ms or better scale. Meaning, the transition from one second to the next should be no more than 100ms delayed.
You may style this timer in any way you wish.


You may use any library, framework, and any CSS tooling that you wish. You may also use none at all and build it entirely in Vanilla JS!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
