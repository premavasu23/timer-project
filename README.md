# Countdown Timer - Prema Vasudevan

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements

Please construct a countdown timer that is rendered in the browser. A user should be able to use this as a simple timer by adding time and starting and stopping it. Here is a full list of requirements:
- The clock should display four digits for minutes and seconds with a colon between, eg 00:00
- Controls should allow users to:
    - Add one minute to the timer
    - Add 10 seconds to the timer
    - Add one second to the timer
    - Start / Stop the timer
    - Reset the timer to zero
- Once the timer reaches zero, the timer should stop counting down and default to the reset state. Adding an effect of some sort to indicate that the timer has reached zero is encouraged but is not required.
This timer must be precise â€“ Precision should be on a 100ms or better scale. Meaning, the transition from one second to the next should be no more than 100ms delayed.
You may style this timer in any way you wish.


You may use any library, framework, and any CSS tooling that you wish. You may also use none at all and build it entirely in Vanilla JS!
